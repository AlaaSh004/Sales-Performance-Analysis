# Sales-Performance-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end sales analysis using the Sample Superstore dataset.  
The analysis was conducted using Python for data cleaning and exploratory analysis, followed by building an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize key business insights.

The goal of this project is to analyze sales performance, profitability patterns, and regional behavior to support data-driven decision making.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze overall sales and profit performance.
- Examine the relationship between discount and profitability.
- Compare regional sales and profit stability.
- Identify underperforming sub-categories.
- Build a clear and interactive executive dashboard.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI
- GitHub

---

## Data Preparation
- Removed duplicates
- Checked and handled missing values
- Converted relevant columns for analysis
- Generated correlation matrix
- Performed regional and sub-category profitability analysis

---

## Key Insights
- A negative correlation exists between discount and profit, indicating that higher discounts are associated with reduced profitability.
- Profit performance varies across regions, with some regions showing higher volatility and instability.
- Certain sub-categories generate consistent losses and may require strategic review.

---

## Recommendations
- Re-evaluate discount strategies to protect profit margins.
- Investigate regions with high profit variability to improve operational stability.
- Review pricing or product strategy for consistently loss-making sub-categories.
